The Resume Reader is a Python-based tool designed to automatically extract and read text from resumes in both PDF and image formats. 

It utilizes PyMuPDF to directly extract text from digital PDFs, and Tesseract OCR with pdf2image for scanned or image-based resumes. 
This project helps automate the process of reading resumes, making it ideal for HR systems, job portals, or recruitment tools. 
The extracted text can be further processed for parsing key information like names, emails, skills, or job experience.
